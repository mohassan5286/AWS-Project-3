# AWS-Project-3
This repository contains my third project for the AWS scholarship program, where I developed a landmark image classifier. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience, simulating real-world applications in computer vision. The model, reviewed by an AWS ML engineer, showed significant learning and performance improvements.
